### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on a 2D Game in Unity. I'm intrested in HTML/CSS/Java, Python, and C# programming. In my spare time (eg. when I'm n0t doing homework or coding), I like to draw pixel art.

If you really wanna talk to me, email me at lwgames0423@gmail.com (please don't email me)
